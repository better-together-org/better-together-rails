# We Are Better Together

We are a community of and for community builders. Our members are working together to build a better tomorrow. We promote local resilience by encouraging people to communicate with and support one another and share their knowledge, skills, resources and time. 

The Better Together Community Engine is currently in the design phase and is undergoing preliminary development. We are currently looking for people and organizations to join and help build the platform.

## Cooperative Organization Structure
Better Together was founded to collaboratively design, build and maintain a community platform owned and operated by its members. Better Together is a cooperative community where you belong and make the decisions. By operating as a cooperative, members will make decisions together through proposals, discussions and voting. 

## Partner Organizations
Better together is proud to partner with its member organizations to support the development of the platform. If you would like to become a development partner, please get in touch.
